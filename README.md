# Nexus In order to Coordinate, Organize and Localize Everything aka NICOLE

This project aims to be an in house, easy to use organisational tool.
It aims to help remember where stuff was stored
by providing you with a very easy way of storing this information during your yearly cleanup.
This way you may still find after seven good years.
